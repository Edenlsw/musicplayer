Learn to use loops in Python.

## Introduction

Loops in Python come in a few forms. They all rely on indentation for their
structure, like `if`s do.

### While Loops

While loops execute while a given condition is true, then stop.

```python
# Prints the numbers 1 through 9

num = 1
while num < 10:
  print(num)
  num = num + 1

```

### For-in Loops

For-in loops execute for every item in a collection, then stop

```python
# Prints the numbers 1 through 9

for num in range(1, 10):
  print(num)

```

They also work on lists:

```python
# Prints a list of names

for name in ["Annie", "Boris", "Chris"]:
  print(name)

```

## Demonstration

Stop this video before the exercise starts so you have the chance to try it
yourself first.

## Exercise

Work through these exercises:

* Write a program to print all the numbers from 2321 to 34325 inclusive.
* Write a program to sum all of the even numbers in that range.

## Challenge

Write a program to find the factorial of 17. 

The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by every number below it
until 1. So, 10 factorial is `10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`,
evaluating to 3628800.

When correct, your program should produce the number 355687428096000.
