# Arithmetic

_**This is a Makers Bite.** Bites are designed to train specific skills or
tools. They contain an intro, a demonstration video, some exercises with an
example solution video, and a challenge without a solution video for you to test
your learning. [Read more about how to use Makers

Learn to do simple arithmetic using Python.

## Introduction

Python has all the normal tools for doing simple arithmetic:

```python
>>> 2 + 2 # Addition
4
>>> 4 - 1 # Subtraction
3
>>> 2 * 3 # Multiplication
6
>>> 2 ** 5 # Power (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2)
32
>>> 1343 / 3 # Division
447.6666666666667
>>> 1343 // 3 # Floor Division
447
>>> 1343 % 3 # Modulo (remainder when divided by)
2
>>> (2 + 2) * 4 # Brackets
16
```

## Demonstration

Stop this video before the exercise starts so you have the chance to try it
yourself first.

## Exercise

Calculate these using Python:

* If I have fifty apples and eat twenty-three, how many do I have?
* The number of minutes in 2022.
* If I have 32,452 herring and I want to group them into tanks of 13 herring each:
  * How many tanks do I need?
  * One of the tanks won't have 13 herring in — how many herring will it have?
