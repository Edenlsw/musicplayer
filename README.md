# Python Challenges.

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance [here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/language_intros/challenges/python/README.ed.md#how-to-coach-this)_

In this module you will learn Python. Python is, by most accounts, one of the
top three most popular programming languages in use today. <!-- OMITTED -->
Beyond just being a moderately popular web language, it is very popular in other
software engineering domains like data science, data engineering and
infrastructure (DevOps).

In this module, you will:

* Learn to use Python's basic syntax.
* Learn to test-drive simple procedural programming problems using Python.
* Learn to test-drive programs in Python using Object Oriented Programming.
* Learn to test-drive programs in Python using Functional Programming.

You will do this first by working through some exercises on the language, and
then through a more complex project. Along the way you will build a
terminal-based music player.

## Outline

## Phase One

Work through ten exercises designed to train the basics of Python. If you
already know the basics of Python or you feel like a challenge, feel free to
skip one or all of them.

1. [Running Python](./bites/01_running_python_bite.md)
2. [The Python REPL](./bites/02_the_python_repl_bite.md)
3. [Printing](./bites/03_printing_bite.md)
4. [Arithmetic](./bites/04_arithmetic_bite.md)
5. [Strings](./bites/05_strings_bite.md)
6. [Ifs](./bites/06_ifs_bite.md)
7. [Loops](./bites/07_loops_bite.md)
8. [Data Structures](./bites/08_data_structures_bite.md)
9. [Functions](./bites/09_functions_bite.md)
10. [Classes](./bites/10_classes_bite.md)

## Phase Two

Work through an exercise designed to help you learn how to use Python in a real
application, including unit tests, multiple classes, and external dependencies.

1. [Get Started with Fizzbuzz](./step_01.md)
2. [Create the Music Library](./step_02.md)
3. [Add a Track Class](./step_03.md)
4. [Play Some Tunes](./step_04.md)
5. [Search for Tracks](./step_05.md)
6. [Make it Yours](./step_06.md)

Most people won't complete all of this and that is OK.
